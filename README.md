# Keyboard mappings for use with Karabiner

These are some keyboard mappings which I made for use with [Karabiner]
(https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/).

A description of each file follows below.

###vk\_apps.xml
Virtual Key definitions not provided by Karabiner for launching apps.

###omnikey\_asterisk.xml
The old Northgate OmniKey keyboard had an asterisk between the right Ctrl
and Alt keys. These are mappings to simulate the asterisk with other
keyboards.

###numpad\_apphotkey.xml
Use Left Ctrl + Numeric Keypad keys as Application hotkeys.

###numpad\_multimedia.xml
Use Left Ctrl + Numeric Keypad keys for Volume and Playback keys.

###enhanced\_numpad.xml
Using Shift, Option, or Shift+Option with numeric keypad keys to type in
brackets, symbols, and hexadecimal.

###enhanced\_numpad.svg
A reference illustration for the enhanced numpad.

###enhanced\_numpad.pdf
PDF version of illustration.

###enhanced\_insert.xml
Insert key is rather useless on Macs, so here are definitions to make it
more useful. Good for Leopold FC660 users.

###enhanced\_insert\_apps.xml
Application hotkey definitions for use with enhanced\_insert.

###misc.xml
Other mappings which don't fit anywhere else.
